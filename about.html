			<h1>ABOUT</h1>
			<p>Lets Go is a platform that records information about travel plans among a group. The platform holds information about the trip before, during, and after. This process simplifies the recording of trip information, congregates information, and summarizes what was done.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="b">
			<h1>WHY USE IT</h1>
			<p>This platform will elevate your trip as it stores information about the trip before it even happens, as it is happening, and summarizes the trip at the end of the journey. Being able to easily track and record reduces stress for everyone adventuring on the trip.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="c">

				<li>More relaxed trip</li>
				<li>Transparent information</li>
